-----------
- Make database view its own jsp page
- Fix studentQueue screen to only show queue info - No question info
-     UPDATE: have Queue info. removed question info. still have student info. now fits on one page
- Fix studentInterview screen to only show interview info -No question info
-     UPDATE:  made new file as html so I could view. removed question info, and fit onto one page.
- For both of those screens, update to follow the new instructor screen 
styling/ structure. The older one had a lot of fixed height columns/rows and was 
too complicated, this new one is simpler and more reactive to window resizing.
