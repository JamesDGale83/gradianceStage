Overview
----------
This is a front end demo for the gradience web application. The purpose
is to be able to use java controllers in order to feed the correct types of
data to the jsp files. It will also help to smooth out the navigation between pages.

This project uses maven instead of gradle because I am more familiar with it,
but switching to gradle should not involve too many changes. Other than that,
the jvm and spring boot versions will be the same. 

I am running this on intellij IDEA ultimate 2025.1.3 so you may not be able
to run some of the spring boot features on IDEA community edition, but I am not
100% sure so you may have to just try it out.
